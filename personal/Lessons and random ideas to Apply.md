# Lessons and random ideas to Apply

For the next gig:

Try to getÂ time for due diligence and full access to source code.

- Show me your best
- Show me your worst
- Show me the most mission critical code (core) of the system
- Show me your typical code

Or: Just do this in the first three months.

CI/CD, exception handling, user management, logging and monitoring. DevOps culture.

Do due diligence on all those fronts. In depth review, get good understanding on how good all of those fronts are.

Learned:

- Break down MRs into one single, clear purpose. Try to keep them below 1 day of work.
- Choose your battles carefully. Fight for working on your home turf (CI/CD, automation, backend stuff). I spread my energy too thin, got mostly limited results, credibility suffered with myself and others.

Think with writing and drawing.

Can not be full stack developer with parts of the stack "opaque" to me, like Python/Django was/is in this case.

I need to have deep understanding and preferably respect for technical capabilities of my superiors. How to get there: Due diligence on technology like stated above.

Remember your principles at all times. Practice writing about them. Collect in articles. Such as:

- ~~~~How to use globals
- Environment awareness in code, why it is a no-no.

Idea: Experiment coding with screen recorder on

Hunger and need to succeed is required. Was way too relaxed in last job, did not establish trust and faith in my abilities.

**Develop a habit of note taking around every meeting and conversation of consequence. Use voice recorder and process at end of day?** 

- **Penzu or notion.so?**
- **Tasks in Asana.**

Service focus. What do others need and want?

What do you REALLY want.? What is the common want?

FROM VOICE MEMO:

Write an article about my experience at Pay Analytics ? With service to community in mind.

- Why I joined.
- Brute force / Path of least resistence
- No abstractions
- High cohesion, low coupling / decoupling
- What were my mistakes ?
- Why was this such a challenge ?
- One nice elegant solution that I found inspirational

I was lazy. Did not want to put in the effort to find a new job.

Something to think about.

Another point from a voice memo:

When pressed for estimates on a feature, ask back if it is possible to know what is the business problem you want to solve, and how much is it worth to solve that problem? Goes to motivation, control, trust, actual collaboration, and two way communication.

One-ones is actually a good idea. Conduct regular one-one with team and stakeholders.
