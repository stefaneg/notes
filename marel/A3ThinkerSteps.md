# Marel - "How can we leverage DevOps better?" report outline.

## Background

How is the problem relevant to the organisation as a whole ?

### Clarify the purpose

- Why are we talking about this? Ask Deniz for better clarification.
- What are we trying to accomplish? 
  - There is frustration from customers. Team seems to be becoming a bottleneck.
- What central question needs an answer? Ná út´ur glærum. Burnout. 
- How is this problem relevant to the organisation as a whole? 

**What is the purpose of this ?**

### Dig into the past

- What past events or actions should we emphasize ?
- Why do they matter ?
- Can we visually place them on a timeline?
- What containment actions, if any, have been taken already?

What relevant history surrounds this situation ?

### Describe implications and consequences

- What might happen if you don't act ?
- What if you do ?
- What's the trend ? Can you draw it ?
- Is there a critical deadline ?
- What's the urgency?

**So what?**

### Attract a motivated task-force

- Who will read, approve, or contribute to this A3?
- Why do they matter?
- What's their knowledge and attitude towards the situation?
- Why is it relevant to them?

**What's in it for them?**

### Capture the pain

- Are you dealing with a major concern?
- How do others experience it ?
- Frustrated? Discouraged? Overwhelmed? Worried? Trapped? Resentful?

**What is their pain level?**

### Show the benefits

- What are we trying to accomplish?
- Are we seeking opportunities in terms of value? 
  - Simplicity?
  - Convenience?
  - Quality?
  - Speed?
  - Cost?
  - Morale?
  - Prestige?
  - Peace?

**What benefits are we hoping to obtain?**

## Current situation

- How are things right now?
- Facts, not opinions
- "What", "How", not "why"
- Avoid blame and suggesting actions/countermeasures.

**What is actually occurring?**

### Gather the facts first-hand

- Go to the "gemba"
- Are facts based on direct observation?
- Do we understand the challenges of the actual work?

**What do we actually know about the current situation?**

### Outline the process

- How is the work performed?
- Can we visually map the value-stream?
- Is it how "it's actually done" or just how "it should be done"?
- What key elements should we highlight?

**What's the system or process that produces the problem?**

### Gather the data

- What data do you have already?
- What's still missing?
- How are you going to obtain it?
- How much? How long? How many? Where? When?

**What quantitative and qualitative information will give a better picture?**

### Be wary of opinions and assumptions

- Have you verified the information you received?
- Is the information based on evidence or just anecdotes, points of view and hearsay?
- Is it fact-based or just derived from experience?

**What opinions or assumptions must be challenged?**

### Interview key people in each area

- Who owns the process (or parts of it)? Who is affected?
- Whose field knowledge do you need to leverage?
- Who will validate your understanding of the current situation?

**Who do you need to talk to**

## Problem

A "problem" is an observable gap between the current situation and a known expectation of what should be happening.
Ask what, not why (causes) or, worse, who is to blame!

**What's the problem?**

### Classify the problem
- Preventive: What problems are you trying to prevent?
- Kaizen: What standard do you intend to incrementally improve on?
- Maintenance: What standard are you struggling to maintain?

**What type of problem is it?**
**What is the nature of the problem?** (my addition)

### Review the standard or expectation

- What are you comparing the current condition to?
- What's the specific level that must be achieved?
- What's the standard way of doing things? Is it shared and agreed to?

**What should be happening?**

### State the deviation from the expectation

- What´s the gap between the current situation and expectation?
- Is the immediate cause unknown?
- Can you express the presenting problem succinctly ?
- Is the deviation statement too vague? Can it be more specific?

**What's the deviation from expectation?**

### Illustrate the trend and tendency
- Can you draw a line graph to show how the current situation relates to the standard or expectation?
- What are the differences or changes over time?
- Do you see a pattern?
- Is the situation getting worse, better, or staying the same?

**Can you express the deviation visually?**

### Reduce scope
- Are several problems happening simultaneously?
- What is NOT the problem?
- Which problem requires your immediate attention?
- What should you leave out for now?

**What is the narrowest definition of your problem?**

### Break it down
- Where is the problem observed?
- Can you break it down (e.g. by product, region, division, etc)?
- What problem area has the biggest impact on your business?
- What would a Pareto chart highlight?
- What really matters?

**Can you break it down?**

"20% of causes generate 80% of results" -- Pareto Principle

## Target
A "target" is an incremental step towards a management goal. 
E.g. "Reduce Process Cycle Time" from 6 days to 4 days by <date>

**Do what, act on what, to what extent, by when?**

### Improve with purpose
- What specific change will relate to the problem identified?
- Where is the effort going to be directed towards?
- What are you going to tackle first?

**Do you aim to make things Easier? Better? Faster? Cheaper?**

### Align targets to goals
- What are the organisational values, directions, and goals?
- What specific goals is management set to achieve this year, quarter, or month?
- What decisive step can be taken to get closer to a goal?

**Is the target and incremental move towards a goal?**

### Choose a strong action word
- What verb best express the observable change you want to experience?
  - Increase? 
  - Improve? 
  - Make? 
  - Reduce? 
  - Eliminate? 
  - Save? 
  - Widen? 
  - Tighten? 
  - Produce? 
  - Compose? 
  - Propose? 
  - Simplify? 
  - Record? 
  - Measure?

**Do what?**

### Identify the direct object of action
- What will impact the behavior of your internal or external customer?
- What will affect the global rather than the local optimum?
- What do you intend to measurably change?
  - Complexity?
  - Quality?
  - Morale?
  - Output?
  - Time?
  - Cost?

**Act on what?**

### Quantify the target
- What specific improvements do you intend to accomplish?
- Specifically improve by how much?
- From what (%/quantity/state) to what (%/quantity/state)?

**Improve to what extent?**

### Propose a realistic time frame

- When does it need to be done?
- Is the finish date clearly stated?
- Based on the current situation, is it realistic?
- Is it agreed upon?

**By when?**

### Show the target or target condition

- How would a line graph illustrate your target?
- How else can you show it visually and vividly?
- What does the future state look like?

**How can you illustrate the target or target condition?**

### Escalate, if necessary
- Who owns the problem and is responsible for proposing solutions?
- Are you in a position to be able to affect change?
- Whose authorisation or support do you need to move forward?

**Do you need to gain support at a different level?**

"Between an uncontrolled escalation and passivity, there is a demanding road of responsibility that we must follow" 
-- Dominique de Villepin

## Theme

The "theme" describes the focus of the problem-solving effort.
Although it appears as the first section on an A3 report, its is typically finalized only after the nature of the 
problem and target is clear.

**What is the specific focus of the A3?**

### Extract the theme from the target

- Does the theme reflect the contents of the report?
- Is it clear what you intend to accomplish?
- Is this the specific issue?
- Can you derive the statement from the target?

**Do what, act on what?**

## Analysis

The analysis section seeks to identify the (root) causes and contributing factors to the problem. 
Ask "why" the process failed (or may fail) and what is in the way to achieving your target.

**What cause(s) may prevent you from achieving the target?**

### Ask why

- What went wrong? Why?
- What caused what?
- What's the root cause that needs to be eliminated or minimized?
- What's in the way to achieve the target?

**Why did the process fail?**

### Favor simple tools

- What is the simplest problem-analysis tool that you can use?
  - 5 Whys?
  - Fishbone?
  - Diagram of effects?
  - A combination of these?
  - Would a solution-focused approach be more appropriate?

**What is the simplest tool you can use to investigate cause-effect relationship?**

### Look for distinctions and changes

- What's distinctive about this object or condition as compared to others?
- What has changed since the time when the performance was satisfactory?

**What distinction/change could suggest the cause of the discrepancy?**

### Explore all possible contributing factors
- Are all the relevant factors being considered (e.g. human, machine, material, method, environment, measurement, and so on)?
- What areas would a fishbone diagram prompt you to investigate?

**How would you list and classify all potential causes?**

### Narrow down your suspects
- Based on your experience and available information, what are the most likely causes?
- What causes could be set aside?
- Are you using deduction only?

**What's the like source of the deviation? Can you verify it?**

### Dig deep for root cause

- Why does the problem occur?
- What causes it?
- Did you stop at symptoms?
- Cant you trace the chain of causality by repeatedly asking "Why...?" until you reach an (actionable) root cause?

**Did you ask "why" the process failed roughly 5 times ?**

### Test the 5 whys logic with a "therefore test"

- Can you walk the chain of causality in reverse to verify its logic ?
- If you start from the root cause and add "therefore" at the end of each statement in the cause-effect chain, do you logically reach the original problem?

**Does the "therefore test" highlight logical gaps?**

### Let the facts lead to root cause

- Is each step in the cause-effect chain based on evidence rather than assumptions?
- Can you test and confirm each likely cause before proceeding to the next level in the chain ?

**Do you "know" the cause or do you "think" you know?**

### Test causation vs. correlation
- What's the evidence that this cause exists and could lead or contribute to the stated effect?
- Could the effect have happened without it? Is it necessary and sufficient to produce the effect?

**Is there a true cause-effect relationship, or just a correlation?**

### Verify the root cause
- Does the root cause point toward a process that fails or does not exist?
- Is it actionable?
- If neutralised, would the problem be solved?
- If you asked "why" again, would it lead you to a different problem?

**Does the root cause explain each and every aspect of the deviation?**
