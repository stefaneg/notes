## Background

How is the problem relevant to the organisation as a whole ?

Team DevOps is supporting various teams with on-prem development infrastructure. The team does not seem to be responsible for any customer-facing production software, only development supporting software such as BitBucket, Artifactory, etc.
Might also be supporting teams in building ansible IaS/configuration management tools.

The team looks overloaded.

### Clarify the purpose

- Why are we talking about this? Ask Deniz for better clarification. Enumerate problems/issues. Can he give me, say, last 50 ?
- What are we trying to accomplish?
  - There is frustration from customers. Team seems to be becoming a bottleneck.
- What central question needs an answer? 
  - What is causing team DevOps to be a bottleneck?
- How is this problem relevant to the organisation as a whole?
    - Well maintained and performing development infrastructure is critical for developer productivity over the whole organisation.

- **What is the purpose of this ?**
